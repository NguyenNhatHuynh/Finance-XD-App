## Application Architecture

The app follows a clean and maintainable architecture, utilizing the principles of SOLID, separation of concerns, and reactive programming.

- **State Management**: Riverpod is used to handle the state across the app. It ensures reusability, testability, and scalability.
- **Dependency Injection**: Leveraged to decouple the business logic from UI components.
- **Data Layer**: A repository pattern is used to abstract the data sources (local database, remote APIs), making it easy to switch between them or mock them for testing.
- **UI Layer**: The UI is structured into reusable widgets, designed to adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes and platforms.
